### (2020) AA 290: Design and Construction of Acrobot
PI: Professor Zac Manchester.<br>
This project was to design and build an Acrobot hardware demo to run RExLab's trajectory optimization software, as well as to prepare [documentation](https://github.com/RoboticExplorationLab/Acrobot/wiki) assisting future students in building robotics demos. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 the hardware assembly was not completed.
