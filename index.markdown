## (Under construction - please excuse my virtual dust.)

## Goals:
#### Describe personal projects
* Developing a [purchase management system](https://github.com/elsoroka/MAE-Purchase-Automation) for senior design teams (with no dedicated web hosting - only Google Script).
* TimeCrunch - a web app for better scheduling, built in collaboration with students in UCI Information and Computer Science. ([Dev site](http://timecrunch-app.herokuapp.com/) and [Git repo](https://github.com/elsoroka/timecrunch).) Learn why we need it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTYcYobTlnonl9gkaslTzP8L1tKIHzzPtWJQKgxl04q9qA1nP3lZoVkGPOlk0X34PBHDEkT0agPdtcn/pub).

#### Include my resume
(TODO)

#### Include some fun and interesting things!
* Like [spiders wearing water droplets as hats](https://www.boredpanda.com/jumping-spiders-wearing-water-droplet-hats/)
* And [LaTeX code-listing templates](https://github.com/elsoroka/latex-ideas)
* Google Scripts hacks for productivity and happiness (coming soon)
* My favorite coding standards (What? Doesn't everyone have a favorite standard?)
