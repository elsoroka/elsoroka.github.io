Experience
----------

**Engineering and IT Intern, Second Order Effects Inc.**

:   **(Summer 2019)** Worked on a system containing a raspberry Pi and power management PCB. Implemented new
features, wrote unit tests, and corrected issues within existing codebase. Wrote and executed test procedures.
Provided weekly progress updates in meetings with clients.

:   **(Summer 2018)** Developed firmware in C for a custom PCB with an STM32 microprocessor. Developed accompanying
computer-side software in Python to receive data and send timed sequences of commands to the PCB.
Prepared documentation for users and future developers.

:   **(Summer 2017)** Designed PCB housings and test fixtures in Solidworks; created technical drawings for manufacturing.<br>
Modified an existing circuit to meet new customer requirements. Prepared LTSpice simulations, PCB
layout, assembly, testing, and characterization of circuit performance.


:   **(Summer 2016)** Configured version control, project wikis, file sharing, VPN, and remote backups on Linux servers.
Documented server configuration, troubleshooting, and recovery.

**Student Technician, Office of Information Technology, UC Irvine.**
:   **(Academic Year) Winter 2016 - June 2019**
Assisted UCI faculty and students with email, school websites and services, and the campus Internet.
<br>
Assisted in training new students and providing after-hours support.


Projects
----------

**[TimeCrunch Scheduling App](/projects/timecrunch)**; Dec. 2019 - current

:   Recruited UC Irvine computer science students to develop a web app for scheduling events at universities. TimeCrunch builds heatmaps showing when students are in class, allowing events to be scheduled when students are free. The app is live [here](http://timecrunch-app.herokuapp.com/)

**[CanSat Competition Team, UC Irvine](https://sites.google.com/a/uci.edu/cansat/)**; Aug. 2017 - Aug. 2019

:   **(2017)** Founded UCI's CanSat team. Recruited students and collaborated with others to design, build, and test the
CanSat's mechanical systems, ensure requirements compliance, and prepare Preliminary Design Review and Critical Design Review documents. UC Irvine was accepted to compete, successfully launched a CanSat, and placed in the top 20 teams.<br>
Created [software to manage team inventory, budget, and purchase orders](projects/tools-for-student-teams), improving team efficiency.

:   **(2018)** Designed a custom PCB with an ATMega processor to interface with off-the-shelf sensors and XBEE wireless modules. Taught new students about PCB design. Led integration of CanSat mechanical and electrical systems.

:   **(2019)** Planned an independent launch of UC Irvine's CanSat in the Mojave desert. Worked with other student teams to learn amateur rocketry skills in addition to completing the CanSat. Successfully completed the launch in August 2019.


**Autonomous Racing Robot, UC Irvine**; Jan. 2017 - Mar. 2017

:   Worked in a team of 3 to design and build a robot capable of following a pre-programmed course. Implemented feedback control and sensor calibration to overcome unreliable data.

**Maker Faire Project and Presentation**; Spring 2012 - Spring 2014

:   Designed and built an Arduino-powered Turret (from the game "Portal 2") that detected motion, played sounds, and fired Nerf darts. Was selected for the 2014 Bay Area Maker Faire to give a 15 minute presentation on the project and how anyone can become a maker.
Won the Editorsâ€™ Choice award for the project and presentation.

Activities
----------
**IEEE Club Event Coordinator, UC Irvine**; Sep. 2018 - June 2019

:   Collaborated with other students to plan educational and social events. Prepared content and taught workshops on LaTeX, Excel, and Google Script. Wrote weekly newsletters promoting club events.
<br>Implemented checklists to standardize event planning and prevent tasks from being missed.
