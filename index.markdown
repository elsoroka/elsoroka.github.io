My favorite phrases to see in research are "globally optimal" and "provably correct". I am a PhD candidate in Aeronautics and Astronautics: my research applies methods from formal verification and statistics to help autonomous vehicles navigate long-tail situations.

I enjoy understanding and improving complex systems of all types. As a volunteer event planner in Aero/Astro, my favorite tasks were large logistical challenges where I could collaborate with others and share the work and excitement of pulling an event together. I have also worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant and am currently developing a one unit course on advanced Julia programming. In my spare time, I enjoy climbing and designing custom stickers.
