Research
---------

**Online Learning in Long-Tail Situations**, PI: Sanjay Lall, Stanford University; Jun. 2023 -- present.
* Proposed a framework for autonomous vehicles to navigate long-tail situations by learning temporal logic rules in real time from observations of other drivers' actions.
* Implemented intersection traffic rules using the CommonRoad software suite, modifying CommonRoad Python software to support new features.
* (in progress) Applied conformal prediction to compute statistically rigorous confidence intervals for trajectory predictions.
* Proposed using conformal prediction to compute temporal logic rules that describe predicted trajectories with a given confidence level.


**Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) package**, PI: Sanjay Lall, Stanford University; Jan. 2023 - Aug. 2023.
* Developed a Julia package providing a novel high-level interface for specifying SMT problems in Julia. The software compiles the high-level specification to the low-level \textsc{smt-lib} format and performs two-way communication with solvers using pipes and Julia's Process library.
* Configured GitHub workflows to deploy code, build documentation, and enforce unittest coverage with Codecov.
* Publication: [*Satisfiability.jl: Satisfiability Modulo Theories in Julia* (preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08778)
* [GitHub repository](https://github.com/elsoroka/Satisfiability.jl}{https://github.com/elsoroka/Satisfiability.jl)

**Motion Planning with Temporal Logic**, PI: Sanjay Lall, Stanford University; May 2022 - Jun. 2023.

* Applied signal temporal logic (STL), a language for expressing logical statements about time series data, to express optimization problems with Boolean combinations of constraints.
* Represented STL constrained problems using mixed integer methods. Linearized constraints and reduced the number of binary variables, resulting in faster solve times.
* Prepared Python code comparing Gurobi, Mosek, and Z3 for solving linear problems with STL constraints. Compared different solution methodologies to identify promising research directions.
* Implemented the Satisfiability Modulo Convex algorithm in Julia to solve nonlinear convex problems with STL constraints.


**Autonomous Vehicle Planning Interface**, PI: Sanjay Lall, Stanford University; Aug. 2021 - Jul. 2022.

* Surveyed autonomous driving standards and vehicle software designs to design an interface between low-level and high-level motion planning algorithms in autonomous vehicles.
* Prepared simulations in Python using CasADi to solve motion planning problems.
* Publication: [*Designing a Hardware-Agnostic Interface Between Route and Trajectory Planning in Self-Driving Cars*](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9966126/) in CCTA 2022.


Teaching
----------
	
**Advanced Julia Course Development**, Stanford University; Nov. 2023 -- present.
